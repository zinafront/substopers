To take into account:
1. External resources being used: Bootstrap 4.2.1., FontAwesome 5.6.3 and Google Charts. All of them externally referenced via CDN.
2. Just in case, Styles have been coded using SaaS preprocessor and compiled into a regular CSS which is being referenced in HTML file.
3. Different than the Google Charts examples included for reference, no further JavaScript has been used.
4. View was successfully tested in IE 11.
